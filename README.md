**Project Title**: FMCG Warehouse: Optimizing Amazon's Distribution Efficiency

**Overview:**
This project focused on analyzing and optimizing Amazon’s warehouse and distribution operations specifically for the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) segment. Given the high velocity and volume of FMCG products, the goal was to enhance warehouse performance, streamline inventory flow, and improve delivery turnaround time while minimizing costs.

**Objectives:**

Identify operational inefficiencies in Amazon’s FMCG warehouse layout and processes

Optimize inventory placement and picking routes to reduce handling time

Apply data-driven demand forecasting to better manage stock levels.

****Methodology****

Conducted end-to-end warehouse process mapping.

Used historical order patterns to build a predictive demand model

Evaluated transportation and last-mile delivery links from the warehouse

**Outcomes:**

Proposed a restructured warehouse zoning system based on item frequency

Improved order picking efficiency by ~20% in simulation scenarios

Reduced average dwell time and optimized labor allocation

Delivered a scalable blueprint for high-throughput FMCG distribution in large fulfillment centers.
